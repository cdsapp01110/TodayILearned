## Overview

**Today I Learned** is a full-stack web application that brings a daily dose of curiosity and learning to users. This interactive platform allows users to explore and share fascinating facts on various topics. From mind-blowing discoveries to interesting tidbits, users can engage by voting on the facts, providing valuable feedback, and even contributing their own knowledge to the community.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - React

- **Backend:**
  - Online Database and API: [Supabase](https://supabase.io/)

## How It Works

1. **Database and API Creation:**
   - I leveraged the power of Supabase, a free service, to create an online database and API for our application data. This ensures seamless interaction and real-time updates.

3. **React for Building the App:**
   - Recognizing the challenges of writing apps solely in JavaScript, I opted for the React library. This allowed me to build a responsive and user-friendly interface, enhancing the overall user experience.

4. **Deployment with Netlify:**
   - The final project finds its home on Netlify. Users can access the platform at [https://funfactswithtodayilearned.netlify.app/](https://funfactswithtodayilearned.netlify.app/) and enjoy a continuous stream of engaging facts.

## Features

- **Vote and Feedback System:** Users can express their opinions on facts by voting them up based on whether they find them interesting, mind-blowing, or false. This creates a dynamic and engaging environment.

- **User Contributions:** Empowering users to be contributors, the platform allows them to add their own facts to enrich the content. This fosters a collaborative and diverse community.

- **Categories for Organization:** To enhance user experience, a categorized approach is implemented. Users can explore facts based on different topics, making it easy to find content aligned with their interests.
